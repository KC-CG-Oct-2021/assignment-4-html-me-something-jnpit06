      <h2> Is there really a difference between Joy and Happiness?</h2>
      <p> One of the great questions of life: Is there really a difference between Joy and Happiness? 
         If you walk down the street stop and ask complete strangers the question, "Is there a really a difference between Joy and Happiness?"
         You would get many different answers. According to most psychologist: Joy is more consistent and is cultivated internally when one finds peace with who you are, your purpose in life, and the season that you are currently in.
         Happiness happens more from external factors: people, places, things, thoughts and events.

      <h3>How does one find Joy?</h3>
      <p>There is no right or wrong answer to this question. An indvidual has to determine what make them happy and what brings them enough peace to bring the inner joy.
         The last couple of years have been a struggle for me and I have spent a great deal of time try answer the questions: What makes me happy? How do I find inner joy during this season of my life? Every day is a growing process and somedays there have been set backs, but the important part is to keep getting up and moving forward.
         I have found that spending time outdoors, taking pictures, reading, and talking with someone close to me has helped me find my Joy!
